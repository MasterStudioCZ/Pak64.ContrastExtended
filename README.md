# Introduction
**Pak64.ContrastExtended** is a pakset for Simutrans, meant to be an extended version of now-abandoned **Pak64.Contrast.**. Just like the original, it is supposed to be a minimalistic pakset with a focus on massive, effective passenger networks and urban planning, with high construction costs and low maintenance costs. However, **Pak64.Contrast** isn't quite complete. It has following features:
- One set of buildings for all climates
- Only one industry (blocks) and passengers
- Very limited range of vehicles, including only one aircraft and one ship

After the project's last update (*Pak Contrast 910*, April 2013), pakset's creator, Kristian Koerselman, outlined his plans for the next update:
- A new industry
- A new kind of tram
- A train carriage for transporting blocks
- Buses

Unfortunately, Kristian left the project before implementing these features. Still, he left it in a surprisingly playable state. Despite its limited scope, it is highly unique among other paksets, primarily with its minimalistic graphics and focus on passenger transport.

# Roadmap
**Pak64.ContrastExtended** aims to create a maintained version of **Pak64.Contrast**. However, the plan is not only to update the pakset with features Kristian has outlined but also to implement many others. Below is (an incomplete) list:
- [ ] **A set of buildings for each climate**. This is currently being worked on. Buildings from different climates will still look minimalistic and largely the same, but with one distinguishing feature - rooftops dependent on the climate the building is located in. This addition is meant to add more diversity variety.
- [ ] **New industries and goods**. In the original pakset's file *Goods.dat*, a new good named *Reports* was hidden. It was, however, commented out, which means that it was ignored by the game. Mail was also there.
- [ ] **Elevated and underground networks**. Those will probably fit the original pakset's focus on transporting large passenger flows with efficiency the most.
- [ ] **New trams**. This includes **freight trams**, once *mail* or *reports* goods are implemented.
- [ ] **New rail vehicles**.
- [ ] **Buses**.
- [ ] **New airplanes**.
- [ ] **New ships**.
- [ ] **More landmarks**. There is currently only one, a church.
- [ ] Maybe, but only maybe, a **telegraph/ethernet networks**? These would - unlike other networks - have high maintenance costs, but they would also transport *mail* very, very quickly and efficiently, making them perfect for long-distance transport.

# Current status
This pakset is currently under semi-active development. It is still not in a state where you could just compile it and play Simutrans with it. However, work is currently being conducted to change that.
